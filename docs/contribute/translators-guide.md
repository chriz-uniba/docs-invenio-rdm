# Getting involved as a Translator

Translation is done with the help of [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/). To become an invenioRDM-translator follow these steps:

## Step 1 - Get a Transifex account

Sign up for a free Open Source Transifex account at [https://www.transifex.com/signup/open-source/](https://www.transifex.com/signup/open-source/) (any other Transifex account will do as well).

In case you stuck, check out the [Transifex Getting Started Guide](https://docs.transifex.com/getting-started-1/translators).

## Step 2 - Join the inveniosoftware team

Ask to join the inveniosoftware team: [https://www.transifex.com/inveniosoftware/invenio/dashboard/](https://www.transifex.com/inveniosoftware/invenio/dashboard/).
Then get in contact with the invenioRDM translation team via [Discord `#rdm-translations`](https://discord.gg/Ya7qSG43Br). They will need to accept you in the inveniosoftware team.

## Step 3 - Find your language

Check for the existing [languages](https://www.transifex.com/inveniosoftware/invenio/languages/).

- If the language you want to translate to does not yet exist:
    - Click the `Request language` button and search there for the language you need.

    - Check with the invenioRDM translation team via [Discord `#rdm-translations`](https://discord.gg/Ya7qSG43Br). They will need to accept the request. When it is accepted you will be able to join the team as described in the next line.
- If the language you want to translate to already exists:
    - Click on that language and there click on the `Join team` button.

## Step 4 - Learn about your translation team

- Check with the invenioRDM translation team via [Discord `#rdm-translations`](https://discord.gg/Ya7qSG43Br)
    - to get sorted within your language team.
    - to find out whether you need the [reviewer](https://docs.transifex.com/teams/understanding-user-roles#reviewers) status.

## Step 5 - Get familiar with Transifex

- Get started by:
    - interacting with your and other language teams (e.g., via [Discord `#rdm-translations`](https://discord.gg/Ya7qSG43Br)).
    - [reading about using Transifex](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/translating-with-the-web-editor).
    - [reading about helpful tools in Transifex](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/tools-in-the-editor).
    - [reading about html-context in Transifex](https://docs.transifex.com/translation/html-files).
    - [reading about pluralized strings in Transifex](https://docs.transifex.com/localization-tips-workflows/plurals-and-genders#how-pluralized-strings-are-handled-by-transifex).

## Step 6 - Check out workflows, experiences and advises

There are some workflows to be aware of and we collected some advises and experiences that you might find useful:

- Every change you make, should be reviewed by another member of your language team. You might need to press the `Unreview`-Button after changing a reviewed item.
- For each item you translate/review you can add comments including mentioning other members using `@name`.
- Several words/sentences appear in different places and packages. To create consistency, try to use the same translations. You might find the [transifex-inveniosoftware-Search Strings](https://www.transifex.com/inveniosoftware/search/) and its Filters helpful.

- Gender-neutral language: if the language you translate to uses different words for male, female, etc.
    - try to use a neutral way.
    - try to stick to one translation style.
- Sometimes it is hard to translate a sentence without seeing its context. If you cannot find it in the invenioRDM user interface (e.g., in the [invenioRDM-demo](https://inveniordm.web.cern.ch/)) contact the invenioRDM translation team in [Discord `#rdm-translations`](https://discord.gg/Ya7qSG43Br). They can point you and show you some tricks.
